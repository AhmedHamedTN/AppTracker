App Tracker is a productivity widget that gives you a window to your app usage history.

With the premium version, you can page beyond the first 4 apps, or even fill up a 4x4 screen with your top 16! Lots of combinations.

Note: this is simply a license for App Tracker Free. You'll still need the free version installed.

<p align=center><b>Overview</b></p>

App Tracker is a tool for organizing your apps based on usage history.  It maintains a running tally of which 
apps you use the most and how recently you invoked them.  Using this, you can set up widgets that display your 
most commonly used or recently used apps.

<p align=center><b>Homescreen Widget</b></p>

To invoke the widget, long-press on the homescreen, choose "Widgets," then choose "App Tracker," and 
then set the configuration options. 
Feel free to put multiple widgets on the same screen.

<p align=center><b>Standalone Application</b></p>

The standalone app allows you to view 
all tracked applications and manage which ones appear in the ranking.  To hide 
apps from the ranking (for instance, commonly used apps like the Dialer and Browser), 
hit Menu, Settings, and then Apps to Exclude.

<p align=center><b>Free vs. Premium Versions</b></p>

<p/>App Tracker Free is a fully-functional app and widget.  
The premium version simply expands upon the free version by offering additional customization.  

<p/>For instance, the premium version gives you navigational "&lt;" and "&gt;" buttons to page between results, 
so you can see more than just 4 apps.  This means that you could even fill up a 4x4 
homescreen with 4 App Trackers, allowing you to see your 16 top apps! 

<p/>Additionally, the premium version allows you to show or hide the page navigation buttons, app titles, 
and app descriptions, so you can personalize the look and feel of the widget.  The 
"stretch to fill" setting allows you to choose whether to keep all App Tracker widgets consistently aligned, 
or to let the icons stretch to fill any leftover space.

<p align=center><b>Sorting</b></p>

<p/>App Tracker offers three ways to sort your data: Recent, Most Used, and Time Decay.   
Recent and Most Used are pretty intuitive, but Time Decay merits some explanation.    

<p/>Time Decay can be thought of as a balance between Recent and Most Used.  Basically, an app's score is initially based 
on its number of hits, but its score starts to "decay" the longer you don't use it. You can think of it as a kind of 
"Billboard Top 100" view.

<p/>Using the Time Decay Constant setting, you can dial up or down how fast app scores decay. 
Lower values mean they decay more quickly. 
If you're curious about how it works, here is the update function that gets periodically applied to the scores: 

<p/><font face="Courier New">update(s) = 
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s*<i>e</i><sup>(t'-t)/(-c*86400000)</sup></font>

<p/>...where <font face="Courier New">update()</font> is the update function, <font face="Courier New">s</font> is the score, 
<font face="Courier New">t'</font> is the current time (in milliseconds), 
<font face="Courier New">t</font> is the time of the last update, 
<font face="Courier New">c</font> is the decay constant, and 86400000 is the number of milliseconds in a day.  

<p/>The default decay constant is 7, meaning that an app that was accessed 7 
days ago will have its score decay to about 1/<i>e</i> (~0.3679).  So the 
default view is a sort of "flavor of the week" view.

<p align=center><b>FAQs</b></p>

<p/><i>Why don't the icons align with the native icons?</i>

<p style="margin-left:10pt">If you look at the additional information that has to be 
fit into the widget (like the navigation buttons and the app subtext), you'll see that 
there's no way to make the icons line up with the native ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10pt">And even if the user chooses 
to hide that information, it can't work consistently across all Android phones.  Different Android 
phones have different Launcher apps (e.g. Google vs. HTC, HelixLauncher vs. Cyanogen), so there's 
no way (AFAIK) to make a widget that will exactly fit all of them.</p>

<p/><i>What's with the "Tracking in progress" notification?</i>

<p style="margin-left:10pt">App Tracker uses a lightweight background process to monitor 
app usage activity. However, the Android system is often hostile to background processes, 
unless they have an associated notification.  So if you disable the 
notification icon, Android might sometimes kill the process without giving it a chance to 
recover. This leads to unwanted behavior, like the widget not being updated when you launch an app.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10pt">However, this situation mostly applies to older phones with limited resources. If you 
have a high-end Android device (Droid, EVO, Nexus One, etc.), then you can probably get away with 
disabling the notification icon. But if you're not sure, then I recommend leaving it on.</p>

<p align=center><b>Overview</b></p>

App Tracker is a tool for managing apps based on your usage history.  It maintains a running tally of which 
apps you use the most and how recently you invoked them.  Using this, you can set up widgets that display your 
most commonly used or recently used apps.

<p align=center><b>Sorting</b></p>

</p>App Tracker offers three ways to sort your data: Recent, Most Used, and Time Decay.   
Recent and Most Used are pretty intuitive, but Time Decay merits some explanation.    

</p>Time Decay can be thought of as a balance between Recent and Most Used.  For instance, an app that you used 10 times a  
month ago may not have as high of a score as an app you used 5 times yesterday.  
As such, Time Decay can be pretty convenient for tracking what your "favorite" apps are at any given time. 

</p>Using the Time Decay Constant setting, you can dial up or down how fast apps decay. 
Lower values mean that apps scores decay more quickly - i.e. the scoring prefers recency to number of hits. 
If you're curious about how it works, here is the update function that gets applied periodically throughout the day: 

</p><font face="Courier New">update(s) = 
</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s*<i>e</i><sup>(t'-t)/(-c*86400000)</sup></font>

</p>...where <font face="Courier New">update()</font> is the update function, <font face="Courier New">s</font> is the score, 
<font face="Courier New">t'</font> is the current time (in milliseconds), 
<font face="Courier New">t</font> is the time of the last update, 
<font face="Courier New">c</font> is the decay constant, and 86400000 is the number of milliseconds in a day.  

<p/>The default decay constant is 7, meaning that an app that was accessed 7 
days ago will have its score decay to 1/<i>e</i> (~0.3679).  So you can think of the default view as a "week" view.

<p align=center><b>Free vs. Premium Versions</b></p>

</p>App Tracker Free is a fully-functional app and widget.  
The premium version simply expands upon the free version by offering additional customization.  

<p/>For instance, the premium version allows you to use the "&lt;" and "&gt;" buttons to page between results, 
so you can see more than just 4 apps.  This means that you could even fill up a 4x4 
homescreen with 4 App Trackers, allowing you to see your 16 top apps! 

<p/>Additionally, the premium version allows you to hide the page navigation buttons, app titles, 
and app descriptions, so you can personalize the look and feel of the widget.  The 
"stretch to fill" setting allows you to choose whether to keep all App Tracker widgets consistently aligned, 
or to let them stretch to fill any leftover space.

<p align=center><b>Standalone Application</b></p>

Additionally, both versions of App Tracker offer a standalone app to view 
all tracked applications and manage which ones appear in the ranking.  To hide 
apps from the ranking (for instance, commonly used apps like the Dialer and Browser), 
hit Menu, Settings, and then Apps to Exclude.

<p align=center><b>FAQs</b></p>

</p><i>Why don't the icons align with the native icons?</i>

<p style="margin-left:10pt">If you look at the additional information that has to be 
fit into the widget (like the navigation buttons and the app subtext), you'll see that 
there's no way to make the icons line up with the native ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10pt">And even if the user chooses 
to hide that information, it can't work consistently across all Android phones.  Different Android 
phones have different Launcher apps (e.g. Google vs. HTC, HelixLauncher vs. Cyanogen), so there's 
no way (AFAIK) to make a widget that will exactly fit all of them.</p>

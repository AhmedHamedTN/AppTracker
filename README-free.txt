Who needs home screen icons? This 1x4 widget displays your 4 most recent or most used apps, and keeps them constantly updated.  It's simple, but surprisingly handy.

Also includes a standalone app that lets you browse your complete app usage history.

Note: App Tracker starts tracking only after you first launch it.

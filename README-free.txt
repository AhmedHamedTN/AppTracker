Who needs home screen icons? This widget displays your 4 most recent or most used apps, right on your home screen! No more need to fumble around when you accidentally close an app.

Also includes a standalone app that lets you see your complete app usage history.

Note: App Tracker starts tracking when you first invoke it.
